# Maestro_Intellect_Projects
During this internship, I was assigned tasks across three levels of complexity:

Basic Level: I worked on data analysis projects, specifically performing crop production analysis using Microsoft Power BI. The tasks involved analyzing crop yield, sales trends, and growth patterns, creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to derive actionable insights.

Intermediate Level: I contributed to an MLOps project, where I developed and deployed a machine learning model following MLOps best practices. This included data preprocessing, model training, versioning, containerization using Docker, and deployment using cloud services, ensuring scalability and reproducibility of the ML workflow.

Advanced Level: I was tasked with building a complete end-to-end project on Generative AI. This involved designing, training, and fine-tuning generative models, integrating them into an application pipeline, and ensuring proper evaluation and deployment, showcasing the ability to handle complex AI workflows from data collection to deployment.
